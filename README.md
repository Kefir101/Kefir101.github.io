The website URL is the same as the repository name: kefir101.github.io

This website is my personal (and first) website which details many of the programming projects that I have worked on, 
but also includes games and acitivies to play with like billiards, cookie clicker, and a particle text maker, all from created by me from scratch.

Interestingly, this entire project started out when I wanted to create a basic website for my high school Java class, 
so I learned web development from scratch (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to implement the billiards game I had made in Java so that I could transform it into Javascript
to host on the website. Ever since then, I've been adding to the project. I worked on it heavily from May to June of 2021, 
but then had to focus on college applications and so I have only continued recently in November.

Every part of this website is still a work in progress (currently at roughly 3000 lines, not including comments), 
for I am constantly tweaking existing parts and adding new features. I'm currently expaning the settings page for more customization of the website, 
adding an integrated cookie clicker game, and adapting the organization of the page to account for different screen sizes/ratios.
