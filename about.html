  <h1>Hello there reader!</h1>
  <p>This is my very <em>first</em> website, which is built in html, javascript, and css (fancy names: HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets),
  and is programmed in the <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> IDE as well as Processing and p5.js, then uploaded to a repository on Github, and then hosted as a website by Vercel! 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Currently, on this website there are <strong>4 paths</strong>: the login, an account to play on, all my games/projects that I have made, and this about me as well. 
    To navigate through the website, click on the links below.
